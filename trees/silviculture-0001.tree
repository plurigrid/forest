\p{\em{Silviculture} involves the methods for establishing and maintaining communities of trees and other vegetation that have value to people.... Silviculture also ensures the long-term continuity of essential ecologic functions, and the health and productivity of forested ecosystems.}

\p{Isn't this just overleaf but with forester instead of LaTeX?}

\p{For the impatient who want to play with things instead of reading about them: [live demo](http://silviculture-demo.localcharts.org).}

\p{Silviculture is a web app for collaborative editing of a [forest](http://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml). It looks like this:}

\p{For a 3-minute introduction to the main features, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN4bvquLg4g).}

\p{If you would like to contribute, the source is [on github](https://github.com/LocalCharts/silviculture). It's pretty janky right now; the focus was getting a demo in front of people to show that the core ideas were possible and awesome.}

\p{If you would like to financially support silviculture development (specifically, the features in the [[silviculture-0003]]), you can [donate to the Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/contact); if you put "silviculture development" in the donation memo, we will use those funds for silviculture development. Also, silviculture wouldn't be possible without forester, and if you want to support forester development you can donate to [Jon Sterling's ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jonmsterling).}

\p{Thanks to [[toposinstitute]] and [[good-forever]] for supporting development of silviculture.}
